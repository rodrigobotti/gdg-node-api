# gdg-node-api

Simple REST api written in NodeJS with the purpose of teaching basic REST api concepts and how to implement them in the aforementioned platform.

## The workshop
We're going to build a user CRUD api that also handles the orthogonal concepts of authentication, authorization, request validation and error handling.

The repo was prepared with branches in specific states:

- **master**:
  - code scaffolding
  - hello world endpoint
- **feature/endpoints**:
  - CRUD endpoints implemented
- **feature/auth**:
  - login endpoint
  - authenticated user routes
- **feature/validation**:
  - request validation using schemas
- **feature/authorization**:
  - routes with authorization verification
- **final**:
  - final version of the code
  - hello world stuff removed
  - postman collection
